            Pounded yam or Iyán(Yoruba) is a Nigerian food native to the Yoruba, Igbo, Ebira and Tiv ethnic groups.
            It is a traditional food. It is prepared by pounding boiled yam with a mortar and pestle. 
            Pounded yam is similar to mashed potatoes but heavier.

            <br>
            Iyán is consumed in Ondo State, Ijesha, Edo, Benue and Ekiti in Nigeria, among others.

            <p>My name is <b>Doris Owoeye.</b> I started having <i>interest in technology</i> in my third year of my undergraduate studies,
                although I wasn't in Science or Technology field. So I find it difficult to navigate my bearing. I started 
                taking courses relating to <i>software development</i> because that was my focus area in technology.
                I'm passionate about <i>technology</i> and how it can be used to <i>solve contemporary problems</i> around us. I intend using
                my skills and knowledge to <b>create solutions to mankind</b> using technology.

            <p>Transiting into technology field, I have been able to learn <i>python as a backend developer.</i> Prior to Stutern program
                Cohort 1.4, I had no knowledge of html and css because I assumed they were languages for frontend developer. Thanks to the
                learning program, I realized that <b>HTML and CSS isn't a programming language</b> but instead <i>html is a markup language</i> that is used to
                create web pages while <i>css is a styling language</i> and is used to style the web pages. 
                I learnt that <b>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</b> and it's a major factor to <i>beautify and design web pages.</i>
                It can be used for website layout for our web page design.

            <p>In CSS, I learnt what <b>paddings, margins and borders</b> are and how they can be used and also their differences.
                Padding is the <i>space between content and border.</i> Margin is the <i>space that surround the content, padding and border element.</i> 
                While border is a <i>frame that surround the content and padding,</i> It can be visible or invisible.
